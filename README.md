# Simple CLI Calculator
This is my first project in cpp so it has no safety features like checking the input is an int before assigning it to the num1 variable. I know its vary barebones but i finished it in about 5 minutes and this isnt supposed to be an amasing way to calculate. I just made this to expriment with the C++ syntax.

FYI, Just updated it and messed around with Memory Allocation and structs.
